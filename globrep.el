;
;  3 août 94 --------7- Martin Boyer <mboyer@ireq-robot.hydro.qc.ca>
; 	Renamed the file as globrep.el to accomodate broken systems that
; 	allow only 14 characters in a file name.  Used query-replace-map.
;	Version 2.1.
; 
; 26 juillet 94 -----6- Martin Boyer <mboyer@ireq-robot.hydro.qc.ca>
; 	Added VC support.  Used `compilation-next-error-locus' and
; 	`compilation-goto-locus' instead of local hacks.  Version 2.0.
; 
; 20 mars 94 --------5- Martin Boyer <mboyer@ireq-robot.hydro.qc.ca>
; 	Added code to preformat a "ChangeLog" entry.  Version 1.2.
; 
;  7 mars 94 --------4- Martin Boyer <mboyer@ireq-robot.hydro.qc.ca>
; 	Updated the documentation after initial comments from the net
; 	and the FSF.  This is version 1.1.
; 
;  1 mars 94 --------3- Martin Boyer <mboyer@ireq-robot.hydro.qc.ca>
; 	Version 1.0: Prepared for distribution through LCD.
; 
; 23 novembre 93 ----2- Martin Boyer <mboyer@ireq-robot.hydro.qc.ca>
; 	Ported to version 19.

;;; DESCRIPTION AND USAGE
;;;
;; This program can be used to search for and replace strings in
;; multiple files.  The idea is to find, in a set of files, all the
;; lines that contain a string to be changed.  Then, one can edit
;; the result of this search, and the program will take care of the
;; tedious task of splicing the changes back into the original files.
;;
;; The search operation can be done separately, before calling any
;; command in this file.  The output of the search has be be in a
;; special format and, indeed, there is an emacs command that does
;; that for you; see the description of the grep command (C-h f grep
;; [RET]).
;;
;; Once you have the list of interesting lines in a "grep" buffer, you
;; can edit it in any way you like, under the following conditions:
;;
;;  	1. The file names and line numbers are not edited.
;;  	2. Lines can be deleted altogether, in which case
;;	   the program will not attempt to put them back in
;;	   the original files.
;;  	3. A single line can be replaced by multiple lines if carriage
;;	   returns (^M) are used to delimit the end of a line.  In
;;	   other words, the program replaces all '\r' by '\n' just
;;	   before putting the edited lines back in place.
;;
;; The last step is to call global-replace-lines.  This command will
;; prompt you for every line in the "grep" buffer -- even those that
;; you didn't edit, asking if you want to carry to the original file
;; the change you made on that line.  You will also be offerred to
;; quit or to perform all replacements without confirmation.  Since a
;; large number of files may be involved, the command will also ask
;; you if you want to dispose of a buffer after all processing has
;; been completed on that buffer.
;;
;; Finally, the command can also present a preformatted "ChangeLog"
;; entry, saving you some time in keeping the ChangeLog file up to
;; date.
;;
;; If you prefer, there are two commands that can call grep for you,
;; and then proceed to carry out the changes.  global-grep-and-replace
;; will prompt you for original and replacement strings, and for a
;; list of files.  It will then call grep, allow you to inspect and
;; modify the result, and then will preform the actual replacements.
;; global-replace is similar, but will skip the inspection stage.
;;
;; You may wish to examine the documentation of the query.el library.
;; But if you don't, here's the short story: whenever you are prompted
;; and a set of possible answers appear between [brackets], the first
;; is always the default.
;;
;;
;; This program differs from tags-query-replace in the following ways:
;; 
;; 1. tags-query-replace requires a TAGS file, and not all files can
;;    be processed by etags.
;; 
;; 2. Shell wildcards are more flexible that TAGS files to specify
;;    which files to process.  Anyhow, some variants of grep can take
;;    a list a files from a file, so the TAGS functionality can be
;;    duplicated.
;; 
;; 3. Mainly, global-replace is more flexible in the way the
;;    replacements are done; the list of lines to be changed, along
;;    with the name of the file where they appear, is directly
;;    available in an emacs buffer.  From then on, the user can elect
;;    not to change lines from certain files, or to process certain
;;    files differently, etc.
;; 
;; 4. Finally, I find it faster and easier to use, since I specify all
;;    the replacements in one operation (editing the result from
;;    grep), and then tell emacs to do the tedious job of actually
;;    putting the changes back in the files.


;;; INSTALLATION
;;;
;; Put this file somewhere in your load-path and byte-compile it.
;; Retrieve and install query.el in the same fashion.
;; Put the following lines in your .emacs:
;;
;; (autoload 'global-replace-lines "globrep"
;;           "Put back grepped lines" t)
;; (autoload 'global-replace "globrep"
;;           "query-replace across files" t)
;; (autoload 'global-grep-and-replace "globrep"
;;           "grep and query-replace across files" t)

;;; BUGS
;;;
;; `global-replace-lines' should try to preserve attributes
;; of the files it visits: 
;;    don't offer to kill the buffer if it existed before the global-replace
;;    don't call vc-checkin if the checkout wasn't done by global-replace
;;
;; There should be a way to say "replace all occurrences in this buffer" or
;; "skip the rest of this buffer".  Perhaps it should even be the default.
;;
;; I don't understand very well the code in vc.el.  Consequently, VC
;; support is probably buggy.

  "Splice back to their original files the (possibly edited) output of grep.
This is a type of query-replace in which the original lines (in the
files) are replaced by those currently in the grep-output buffer.  You
will be asked to replace (y), don't replace (n), quit (q), or replace all.  

When all changes are done in a file, you will be asked to
either save and kill the buffer, simply save it, or leave it as is.
In the replacement text, all ^M are changed to newlines, to allow a
single line to be replaced by multiple lines.

Global-replace will check out files automatically when needed (and
will also offer to steal a lock as a last resort).  Files checked out
this way are automatically checked in."
